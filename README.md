# Pronto!

Pronto is a tool to facilitate the submission process to Calls for Papers. Its a chrome extension that will help you fill in the forms pulling data about your talks stored elsewhere.

Our initial goal is to import talks from Symposium App ([symposiumapp.com](symposiumapp.com)) and give you the option to rapid-fill the CfP form with data from that talk. It will attempt to figure out the right fields for the right information so it should be compatible with most CfP forms, not just OpenCFP.

It will provide a fair balance between flooding CfP's and avoiding the Copy/Paste process regular speakers need to go through everyday.
